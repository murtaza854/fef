Pakistan is considered to be the fifth largest young country in the world. Around 34% of Pakistanis are under the age of 15. It is they who have the power to transform the future of Pakistan. Correspondingly, it is us, the older ones, who have the responsibility to ensure that the youth can secure theirs, their families’, and their country’s future.

What ought to be done? Invest in the health and education of our youth. It is not an either-or choice, has to be both, emphatically and in tandem.
