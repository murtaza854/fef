<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 20px;">Dear All,<br />A
        few nights ago (9<sup>th</sup> March) I watched Dawn TV&rsquo;s show
        Newseye. The discussion subject was off the beaten political track but
        spot-on FEF&rsquo;s heart &ndash; child malnutrition in Pakistan. The
        stats shared by participants were quite damning for a country which has
        80 million children. It further drove home the point around the negative
        economic and social consequences of a do-nothing approach, reinforcing
        our resolve to fight this menace as best we can. Like the allegory of
        the little hummingbird fighting the forest fire with only a drop of
        water at a time in its beak, responded to other animals&rsquo; mocking
        questions with &ldquo;I am doing the best I can&rdquo; - we are glad
        that we can say the same, &rsquo;we are doing the best we can&rsquo;.
        And the heartening part is that unlike the lonely hummingbird we are all
        together in this &ndash; you and I and all the friends of FEF.</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">So, we are here on
        ground in Orangi, where our School Meal Program (SMP) restarted on the 1<sup>st</sup>
        of February after the schools re-opened again and I realized that it has
        been an year now since we served our first meal to the children. It has
        been in fits and starts due to Covid but we persevered. I also recognize
        that in the larger scheme of things, we still have to go the proverbial
        999 steps since we have taken the first step. We started by serving 260
        children and now we have 283, and are looking at expanding our reach to
        another school in Orangi (preferably a publicly managed school). We have
        reached out to the Ministry of Education for this.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">We continue to look at ways and means to
        improve our delivery of nutrition to the children in schools. I am
        emboldened by the active participation of people with expertise in the
        various streams of knowledge that come together to make this initiative
        meaningful and impactful. We keep getting referred to a friend of a
        friend or a relation of a friend who is more than willing to help out.
        We are grateful, as all this stacks up to make us better at what we have
        set out to do.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Ramadan, the month of blessings, is just
        around the corner; we pray that it brings good tidings for all our
        friends. We solicit a small share of your giving for the future of the
        youth that we vow to serve. We also thank our existing supporters.
        Without you, we wouldn&rsquo;t have come this far.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">THANK YOU.</p>
