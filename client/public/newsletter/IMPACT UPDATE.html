<p style="text-align: justify;">Dear All,<br />A few nights ago (9<sup>th</sup> March) I watched Dawn TV&rsquo;s show
    Newseye. The discussion subject was off the beaten political track but spot-on FEF&rsquo;s heart &ndash; child
    malnutrition in Pakistan. The stats shared by participants were quite damning for a country which has 80 million
    children. It further drove home the point around the negative economic and social consequences of a do-nothing
    approach, reinforcing our resolve to fight this menace as best we can. Like the allegory of the little hummingbird
    fighting the forest fire with only a drop of water at a time in its beak, responded to other animals&rsquo; mocking
    questions with &ldquo;I am doing the best I can&rdquo; - we are glad that we can say the same, &rsquo;we are doing
    the best we can&rsquo;. And the heartening part is that unlike the lonely hummingbird we are all together in this
    &ndash; you and I and all the friends of FEF.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So, we are here on ground in Orangi, where our School Meal Program (SMP) restarted on
    the 1<sup>st</sup> of February after the schools re-opened again and I realized that it has been an year now since
    we served our first meal to the children. It has been in fits and starts due to Covid but we persevered. I also
    recognize that in the larger scheme of things, we still have to go the proverbial 999 steps since we have taken the
    first step. We started by serving 260 children and now we have 283, and are looking at expanding our reach to
    another school in Orangi (preferably a publicly managed school). We have reached out to the Ministry of Education
    for this.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We continue to look at ways and means to improve our delivery of nutrition to the
    children in schools. I am emboldened by the active participation of people with expertise in the various streams of
    knowledge that come together to make this initiative meaningful and impactful. We keep getting referred to a friend
    of a friend or a relation of a friend who is more than willing to help out. We are grateful, as all this stacks up
    to make us better at what we have set out to do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ramadan, the month of blessings, is just around the corner; we pray that it brings good
    tidings for all our friends. We solicit a small share of your giving for the future of the youth that we vow to
    serve. We also thank our existing supporters. Without you, we wouldn&rsquo;t have come this far.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">THANK YOU.</p>
