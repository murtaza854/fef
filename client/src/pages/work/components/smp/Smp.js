                    In developing our School Meal Program, we studied Pakistanâ€™s Dietary Guidelines
                    for Better Nutrition which were developed by WHO (World Health Organization)
                    and the Government of Pakistan in May 2018. At the same time, we also looked at
                    similar programs in other parts of the world. In determining the meal menu, we
                    had to consider the local dietary habits of the children in our target ages and
                    of course cost of the meal had a significant impact in deciding what to deliver.
                    As we move forward, we will continue to tweak the meal menus to improve its
                    nutritional value and the cost of the meal.
